- Hello, this is @BlazingEdgeGames, a passionate indie game developer who picked up programming as a hobby.
- I'm really into music and the production side of it, love graphic design, and I enjoy programming! (pretty much the whole package for gamedev)
- Currently studying computer science in university.

- Check out the repo for my latest game "'Tis But A Scratch", I've open-sourced all it's code so people can learn from it and hopefully contribute to the community of fellow game developers. (But please do not redistribute the game)

-Happy Gemedevving, and don't forget to have fun!
